            Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? You know what? It is beets.
            I've crashed into a beet truck. My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give
            you something to cry about you little bastard!

        <h2>Jived fox nymph grabs quick waltz?</h2>
        <p>
            That’s not the only ballroom dance. I take lessons too. There’s Salsa, Tango, Waltz,
            Vienese Waltz, Quick Step, Jive, Swing, Foxtrot, Lindy Hop, Mambo, Cha-Cha, and Merengue.
            There are <a href="#">obscure ones</a> too.

        <h3>How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!</h3>

            Further, fractal geometries are replicated on a human level in the production of certain
            “types” of subjectivity: for example, aging kid quiz show whiz Donnie Smith
            (<a href="#">William H. Macy</a>) and up and coming kid quiz show whiz Stanley Spector
            (<a href="#">Jeremy Blackman</a>) are connected (or, perhaps, being cloned) in ways they
            couldn’t possibly imagine.

        <h4>Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye!</h4>

            You really think you can fly that thing? Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us
            out of here! My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to
            cry about you little bastard! Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye!

            Life finds a way. Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Yes, Yes, without the oops! You're a very
            talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager?

        <h6>Must go faster. Jaguar shark!</h6>
        <p>
            So tell me - does it really exist? I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. My dad once told
            me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard!
            So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs?

        <h2>God help us, we're in the hands of engineers</h2>
        <p>
            Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Hey, take a look
            at the earthlings. Goodbye! God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys
            God. Man creates Dinosaurs. You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do
            you need a manager?

        <p>
            What do they got in there? King Kong? Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the
            pirates don’t eat the tourists. Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Eventually, you do plan to
            have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right?
